### Simple Wiring and construction:

![WireUP](http://brewuno.com/images/simplified-setup-BrewUNO.png)

This is the easiest way to mount your brewuno, you can improve it!

### Installing with Flash Download Tools ([video](http://www.brewuno.com/download/install.mp4))

* Download [bin files](https://github.com/rampanelli/BrewUNO/tree/master/bin)
* Download [Flash Download Tools](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/tools/flash_download_tools_v3.6.6_0.zip)
* Setup like this: [setup](http://brewuno.com/download/esp8266-download-tool.png)
* firmware.bin offset: 0x0
* spiffs.bin offset: 0x00300000
* Click ERASE button
* Click START button
* Connect to BrewUNO wifi (SSID: BrewUNO, Password: brew-uno). AP mode ip: 192.168.4.1
* Scan and configure your wifi under menu

### Installing & Deployment with VS Code

### Prerequisites

You will need the following before you can get started.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - IDE for development **with ESP8266 v2.2.2 platform installed**
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - For building the interface (if you want)
* Bash shell, or Git Bash if you are under windows

Pull the project and add it to PlatformIO as a project folder (File > Add Project Folder).

PlatformIO should download the ESP8266 platform and the project library dependencies automatically.

Once the platform and libraries are downloaded the back end should be compiling.

Edit /data/config/wifiSettings.json with yours wifi configurations.

Under PlatformIO menu: Upload File System image, and then, Upload and Monitor. You will see the ip address to access interface. AP mode ip: 192.168.4.1

### Building the interface

The interface has been configured with create-react-app and react-app-rewired so the build can customized for the target device. The large artefacts are gzipped and source maps and service worker are excluded from the production build.

You will find the interface code in the ./interface directory. Change to this directory with your bash shell (or Git Bash) and use the standard commands you would with any react app built with create-react-app:

#### Download and install the node modules

```bash
npm install
```

#### Build the interface

```bash
npm run build
```

**NB: The build command will also delete the previously built interface (the ./data/www directory) and replace it with the freshly built one, ready for upload to the device.**

#### Running the interface locally

```bash
npm start
```

**NB: To run the interface locally you will need to modify the endpoint root path and enable CORS.**

The endpoint root path can be found in .env.development, defined as the environment variable 'REACT_APP_ENDPOINT_ROOT'. This needs to be the root URL of the device running the back end, for example:

```
REACT_APP_ENDPOINT_ROOT=http://192.168.0.6/rest/
```

CORS can be enabled on the back end by uncommenting the -D ENABLE_CORS build flag in platformio.ini and re-deploying.

## Configuration

Standard configuration settings, such as build flags, libraries and device configuration can be found in platformio.ini. See the [PlatformIO docs](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf.html) for full details on what you can do with this.

By default, the target device is "esp12e". This is a common ESP8266 variant with 4mb of flash though any device with at least 2mb of flash should be fine. The settings configure the interface to upload via serial by default, you can change the upload mechanism to OTA by uncommenting the relevant lines.

As well as containing the interface, the SPIFFS image (in the ./data folder) contains a JSON settings file for each of the configurable features. The config files can be found in the ./data/config directory:

File | Description
---- | -----------
apSettings.json | Access point settings
ntpSettings.json | NTP synchronization settings
otaSettings.json | OTA Update configuration
wifiSettings.json | WiFi connection settings

The default settings configure the device to bring up an access point on start up which can be used to configure the device:

* SSID: BrewUNO
* Password: brew-uno
